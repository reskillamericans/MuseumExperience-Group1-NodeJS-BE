The first started in the mid-1920s, when Allen worked as outside legal counsel to help Boeing establish its new air-transport network and negotiate airport leases in states over which its mail and passenger routes were flown. Allen’s business involvement with Boeing expanded during the next 20 years, both in a legal capacity and as a company director and valued advisor. In 1945, the “right time” came, and Allen’s second Boeing career began, with his appointment to the company’s presidency.",
